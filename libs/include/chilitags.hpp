/**
    Creates an object ready to find the 3D pose of chilitags.

    By default, Chilitags3D assumes an arbitrary, but reasonnable focal length
    (700), and expects the dimensions of the captured images. In this
    configuration, the depth estimation makes sense, but it is not accurate. In
    order to correctly estimate the 3D pose, the intrinsic calibration
    parameters of your camera needs to be provided. To do so, use the
    readCalibration() or setCalibration() methods.

    Chilitags3D also assumes by default that the 3D pose of every detected tag
    is expected, and that every tag is independent from the others, and that
    they are 20 millimetres wide. The method read3DConfiguration() can be used
    to specify which tags are of interest, and how they are arranged on a rigid
    object, and how big they are.

    To first detect th tags in the image, Chilitags3D creates a Chilitags
    instance, which can be accessed through the getChilitags() accessors. This
    Chilitags instance is set to have a persistence of 0, but Chilitags3D sets
    a default persistence of 5 frames for poses it estimates. It also sets a
    gain of .5 to avoid the detected objects to "shake". Please refer to the
    documentation of Chilitags3D::setFilter() for more detail.

    You can also create yourself a separate instance of Chilitagsfor the 2D
    detection of tags and use it by calling
    Chilitags3D::estimate(const std::map<int, Quad> &tags)
    with the output of
    Chilitags::find(const cv::Mat &inputImage)

    Chilitags3D::estimate(const cv::Mat &inputImage).

    default). This parameter is only used to provide meaningful pose
    estimation. Input images of different resolution can be provided to the

    setCalibration().

    \param gain a value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the weight of the
    previous (filtered) position in the new filtered position. 0 means that the
    latest position of the object is returned.

    Chilitags3D manages persistence separately from the 2D detection of
    Chilitags, because an object can be composed of several tags. If one or
    more of these tags are not detected, the pose of the object is estimated
    with the remaining, detected tags. In this case, it would hurt the pose
    estimation to make the individual tags persistent. Chilitags3D thus sets
    the 2D detection to have no persistence, and applies its persistence
    mechanism only after the estimation of the pose. The same goes for the
    position filtering. Note that for independent tags, it should not matter.
